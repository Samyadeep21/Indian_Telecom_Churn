### 📊 Project Overview
In the highly competitive Indian telecom market (Jio, Airtel, BSNL), retaining a customer is **5x cheaper** than acquiring a new one. This project provides an **End-to-End Machine Learning Solution** to predict customer churn and recommend localized retention strategies.

**The Impact:** Reducing churn by just 5% can increase corporate profits by up to 25%.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Predictive Engine:** Powered by **XGBoost** for high-accuracy binary classification.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** A live **Streamlit** interface for "What-If" analysis.
- **Explainable AI (XAI):** Interactive **Plotly** charts showing exactly *why* a customer is at risk.
- **Retention Playbook:** Automated business advice (e.g., 5G trial offers) based on risk probability.

## 💡 Business Insights & Conclusion

**High-Risk Segment**
 Customers using < 2GB data but having high monthly charges are 4x more likely to switch.

**Top Predictors**
 Data_Used and Contract_Type emerged as the most significant features influencing churn.

**Strategy** 
Targeted 5G upgrade offers for moderate-risk users can stabilize the revenue base in Tier-1 Indian cities.
